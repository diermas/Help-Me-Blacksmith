# Help-Me-Blacksmith

This was a game made with a friend during the Global Game Jam 2020, where the theme was Repair.
The game was made over approximately 30 hours.
The idea behind the game is that a customer comes in with a request for a weapon type, and you must choose from various part options to assemble a weapon that best suits the request.
